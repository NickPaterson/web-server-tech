Orange (colour)
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
</p>
<p>
The colour orange occurs between red and yellow in the visible spectrum at a wavelength of about 585 – 620 nm, and has a hue of 30° in HSV colour space. The complementary colour of orange is azure, a slightly greenish blue. With pigments such as paints or inks, a mixture of the subtractive primary colours in the proportion of 75% yellow and 25% magenta produce the secondary colour orange. Orange pigments are largely in the ochre or cadmium families, and absorb mostly blue light.

Etymology of orange

    Main article: Orange (word)

The colour is named after the orange fruit, introduced to Europe via the Indo-European word na-ranja. Before this was introduced to the English-speaking world, the colour was referred to (in Old English) as geoluhread, which translates into Modern English as yellow-red.

The first recorded use of orange as a colour name in English was in 1512,[2] in the court of King Henry VIII.

Orange in human culture

[edit] Academia

    * In the United States, orange regalia is associated with the field of engineering.

[edit] Cosmetology

    * People whose natural hair colour is metaphorically described in English as being red, i.e. redheads, actually have hair that averages a burnt orange colour.

[edit] Geography and history

    * Orange is the national colour of The Netherlands, because its royal family used to own the principality of Orange (the title is still used for the Dutch heir apparent). There is no etymological connection between orange (the fruit and colour) and Orange (the name of the principality), and the similarity is fortuitous.[citation needed] Orange is the colour of choice for many of the national sports teams and their supporters. The nickname of the Dutch national football team is Oranje, the Dutch word for orange. In the modern flag of the Netherlands, red substitutes the original orange, but on royal birthdays, the flag has an additional orange banner. Most geographical usages of the word orange can be traced back to Dutch maritime power in the 17th century.
    * In Ireland the use of orange dates from the reign of William of Orange, the Protestant English king and a Dutch stadholder.

Orange heraldic tincture, in colour and monochrome representations

    * In English heraldry, orange is considered synonymous with the tincture tenne. However, its use as a heraldic tincture is relatively rare, as it is considered a "stain" (a deprecated tincture) by some. In continental heraldry, tenne is more often deemed to denote a burnt orange colour.

[edit] Holidays

    * The colours orange and black represent the holiday Halloween (31 October) because orange is the colour of pumpkins and black is the colour of night and is associated with doom, despair and darkness.
    * The colours orange and brown represent the United States holiday Thanksgiving.

[edit] Military

    * In the United States Army, orange is the colour of the United States Army Signal Corps.

[edit] National colours

    * Orange is the national colour of the Netherlands and is seen on its original flag and coat of arms.
    * Orange, white, and green are the national colours of Ireland, Niger, and Côte d'Ivoire.

[edit] Mysticism

    * In the metaphysics of the New Age Prophetess, Alice A. Bailey, in her system called the Seven Rays which classifies humans into seven different metaphysical personality types, the fifth ray of concrete science is represented by the colour orange. People who have this metaphysical personality type are said to be on the Orange Ray.
    * Orange is used to symbolically represent the second (Swadhisthana) chakra.
    * Psychics who claim to be able to observe the aura with their third eye report that an orange aura is associated with intellectual ambition.[9]

[edit] Ophthalmology

    * A woman named Susan Hogan was born with an extra set of cones that are sensitive in the orange range, as well having the red, green, and blue cones that humans with normal colour vision (i.e. trichromats) possess. She is therefore classified as a tetrachromat, but her extra type of cone is an orange cone instead of the ultraviolet cone possessed by animals such as birds who are tetrachromats in nature. It is estimated that while normal humans can see about 1,000,000 different colours, tetrachromats such as Ms. Hogan can see 100,000,000 different colours. This is because each additional type of cones reacts with the other types of cones in such a way that an addition of a new type of cone means an organism can see 100 times as many colours. (This means that a pentachromat would be able to see 10,000,000,000 (ten billion) different colours.) [10]

[edit] Penology

    * Prisoners incarcerated in many American jails and prisons are made to wear orange jumpsuits so they will be easy to see if they try to escape.

[edit] Prosody

    * Orange is often quoted (along with Purple and Silver (color)) as a word that doesn't rhyme with any other word in the English language. This is debatable - see Orange (word)#Rhyme.

      In a children's book of verse, in a poem titled "Color," there are these lines:

        What is red? a poppy's red, in its barley bed.
        What is orange? Why, an orange--just an orange!
